= Neo4J Demo in Clojure

A simple demo accessing Neo4J using the `gorillalabs/neo4j-clj` library.

== Installation

This project assumes you have already installed Neo4J Desktop (Enterprise Edition). It is availble
for free for local use.  When you download the installer, be sure to copy the Activition Code and
save it.  You will need the Activation Code during the installation process.

Since the Neo4J Desktop is free to use for development, I have not played around with the
open source Docker version of Neo4J.

== Configuration after installation

- Click the top-left "project" icon, then the `+ New` button to create a new DB.  For development purposes,
set the password to "secret" when prompted.  The name of the new DB should default to "neo4j". These creds must
be correct or the code can't connect to the DB (it will fail auth).

=== Verify you have Java, Clojure, and Leiningen set up correctly

Try the following commands, and make sure you get similar output:

```bash
> java --version
java 13 2019-09-17
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 13+33)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 13+33, mixed mode, sharing)

> lein --version
Leiningen 2.9.1 on Java 13 Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM
```

== Run the Unit Tests

I do this so much I have some bash aliases:

```bash
alias lct=" time (lein do clean, test)"
alias lctr="time (lein do clean, test-refresh)"
```

The first one `lct` is generic, the 2nd one `lctr` is for use with the lein-test-refresh plugin.

== Running Unit Tests - Plain

Just type

```bash
> lct   # or `lein clean ; lein test`
```

with result:

```pre
-----------------------------------
   Clojure 1.10.3    Java 15.0.2
-----------------------------------

lein test tst.demo.core
Creating session...
Getting Neo4j version info
Getting APOC version info
  *** APOC not installed ***

Ran 2 tests containing 4 assertions.
0 failures, 0 errors.
( lein do clean, test; )  30.19s user 0.87s system 320% cpu 9.698 total
```

The message "*** APOC not installed ***" shows that we have not installed the free APOC library of
functions for Neo4J.
We want to install APOC. The APOC library is free and very useful, so we normally want to have it available.

=== Install the APOC library

In the Neo4j Desktop window, highlight your project in the left-hand
nav pane..  Then click near the green "ACTIVE" label, which will open the "Manage" screen on the RHS of the screen.
Click on Plugins -> APOC -> Install and Restart.  After the DB has restarted, re-run the tests.

```pre
> lct
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM warning: Options -Xverify:none and -noverify were deprecated in JDK 13 and will likely be removed in a future release.
2021-07-15T16:34:45.646307497 INFO Driver - Direct driver instance 643411416 created for server address localhost:7687

lein test _bootstrap

-----------------------------------
   Clojure 1.10.3    Java 15.0.2
-----------------------------------

lein test tst.demo.core
Creating session...
Getting Neo4j version info
Getting APOC version info
  found APOC library

Ran 2 tests containing 6 assertions.
( lein do clean, test; )  32.61s user 0.85s system 292% cpu 11.452 total
```

Notice that this time it found the APOC library.

== Code Structure

All interesting code is in the NS `tst.demo.core`, under the `test` directory.  I like this naming structure better then
the `-test` suffix as it doesn't mess with the filename, and there is no conflict between hyphens "core-test"
vs underscores "core_test.clj".

== Keeping Dependency Versions Up-To-Date

This project includes the `lein-ancient` plugin, which will tell you if any of your dependency
libraries are out of date. I have an alias:

```bash
alias laca="lein ancient check :all"
```

which will give you a list of version updates you should make, or just

```pre
all artifacts are up-to-date.
```

if you are already up-to-date on everything.
